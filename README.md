# max-vue-snake
A retro snake game on TypeScript + Vue 3 + Vite come with a nixie-tube-like timer / scoreboard and fantasy console for my study.

I write the snake class use two ways: arrays(snake.ts) and linkedlist(snake_linked.ts & linkedList.ts).


# Install & Usage

# Desgin

Most of the graphics are desgined by myself (sorry for my bad design), except the PCB pic in the bottom. You can view the psd file in the Release.

The font of the nixie tube is [Oslo II](https://www.1001fonts.com/oslo-ii-font.html)
